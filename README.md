# Arcade Game
  Based on the classic Arcade game __Frogger__, this project allowed the developer to put into practice, new learned, Object-Oriented coding.  

# Game specifications
### Error Free: game should contain no errors ### and demonstrates the following:
1.  Player can not move off screen
1.  Vehicles cross the screen
1.  Vehicle-player collisions happen logically     (not too early or too late)
1.  Vehicle-player collision resets the game
1.  Something happens when player wins

## Game instructions
1. Open the Index.html file in your browser
1. Use your arrows keys (up, down, left and right) to maneuver the Hero around the board to avoid colliding with bugs.
1. If the Hero and a bug collides, an alert will trigger, and the Hero will be sent back to starting point.
1. If Hero makes it to the water, you will be prompted for your name, then an alert will trigger that you won.

## Game future
#### Future improvements to the game will include a full modal with timer, a score board and/or a you won animation

## Source code
### Can be found here:
[Udacity Arcade Game] (https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)

#### The game assets are all provided.  All coding should be done within the app.js file.

## Challenges and issues
The biggest challenge was getting positioning correct and the coding for collision.
